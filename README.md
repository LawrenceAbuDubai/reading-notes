### What is a growth mindset?

##### it's the believe that one's fundamental abilities can be developed through perseverance and effort it's similar to the *love of learning*.

##### it means when facing **Challenges** you go through them instead of running away or giving up , mistakes can and will mostly happen at first, but its the ability to learn from them and trying out new ways and methods to real your goal. the same thing goes for **Obstacles** when putting effort in dealing with them instead of letting them sabotage your work. as for the **effort** it's self that you put , you will always learn from it , even if a test you do fails , you will still win the knowledge of it and the results of the test, also pushing more and more to reach the goal , along the way you will face **Criticism** and ignoring it might be the easy road , but if you focus on it you will learn a lot from it, because its the fruits of others who *Success* and the fruit of their tests and efforts , so instead of ignoring them or seeing them a threat to your own work , you should learn from them or try to enhance your work to be on par with them or even higher.

##### sometimes we need a push to keep up with the effort demanding from a growth mindset, thats why i keep reminding myself of these points : 

1. *no pain, no gain* nothing will come on silver plate, you will have to work for it and earn it. 
2. being *competitive* many times in most of topics you will face people who are better, would you rather give up ? or grow up to their level? going to their level and winningðŸ˜€.
3. always be *open to changes* , you have your own **way / style** of doing things , but there are mistakes , thats where you should be open to learn from them and develop your ways and methods to be able to compete on higher levels.
4. being *perfectionist* means you can't accept things if they are not perfect, your ways and methods might be wrong or have loopholes, thats where you put the effort to overcome the challanges and walls in your way to *perfect* your project or your work.
