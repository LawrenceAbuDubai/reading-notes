# what is **Markdown** ?

#### Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling all forms of writing on the GitHub platform.
#### it uses the .md extension.
#### it is used to style text on the web. You control the display of the document; formatting words as bold or italic, adding images, 
#### and creating lists are just a few of the things we can do with Markdown.
#### Mostly, Markdown is just regular text with a few non-alphabetic characters thrown in, like # or *.

there are many code examples of how to use the *md* :

- using the * * to make text between them *italic*.
- using the ** ** to make the text **bold**.
- using the *** *** to make the text both ***italic and bold*** 

#### lists can be made too like we did counting the previous , we can use * or +  or - to list them

we can also add images like this : 
first we add ! 
then [alt]
then (link) 

but without spacing :

there are also the headers , i already used them above, we use # as their sign, # is the biggest and ###### is the smallest sizes : 

# This is a first-tier heading!
## This is a second-tier heading!
### This is a third-tier heading!
#### This is a forth-tier heading!
##### This is a fifth-tier heading!
###### This is a sixth-tier heading!
