# CSS

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) lets you make beautiful web pages, but how does it function behind the scenes? This article explains what CSS is and how to use it with a simple syntax example, as well as some crucial vocabulary.

We discussed what HTML is and how it is used to mark up documents in the Introduction to HTML module. Web browsers will be able to read these documents. Paragraphs split onto a new line and have space between them, and headings will appear larger than regular text. To identify them from the rest of the content, links are colored and highlighted. What you're seeing are the browser's default styles, which are very basic styles that the browser applies to HTML to ensure that it is legible even if the creator of the page hasn't given any explicit styling.

## What is CSS for?

CSS, as previously said, is a language for determining how documents are shown to users, including how they are formatted, laid out, and so on.

A document is typically a text file formatted using a markup language â€“ the most prevalent markup language is HTML, although other markup languages such as SVG or XML may also be used.

Presenting a document to a user entails transforming it into a format that your audience can understand. Browsers such as Firefox, Chrome, and Edge are designed to graphically present content on a computer screen, projector, or printer.

CSS can be used to style the text in a document in very basic ways, such as changing the color and size of headings and links. It can be used to make layouts, such as turning a single column of text into one with a primary content section and a sidebar for relevant information. It can even be used to create animation effects. For specific examples, click on the links in this paragraph.

## CSS syntax
CSS is a rule-based language, which means you write rules that specify sets of styles to be applied to certain elements or groups of elements on your website. "I want the main heading of my page to be displayed as huge red text," for example.
